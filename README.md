# Smart System Monitoring Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project implements a system monitoring dashboard that tracks CPU usage, memory utilization, and disk usage in real time. DevOps monitoring tools are used to automatically collect system metrics, and data visualization techniques are applied to present the information using clear and interactive dashboards. The system also classifies overall system behavior to make monitoring easier to understand for students and beginners.

## Objectives
- Monitor system resources in real time
- Automate system monitoring using DevOps tools
- Visualize system metrics through dashboards
- Classify system behavior into meaningful states
- Maintain weekly progress using GitHub

## Tools Used
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Node Exporter
- Docker
- GitHub

## System Architecture
System → Node Exporter → Prometheus → Grafana

## Team Roles
- DevOps Engineer: Monitoring setup, configuration, and automation
- Visualization Engineer: Dashboard creation and data visualization

## Project Timeline
The project is developed over a period of five weeks, with each week completing a functional milestone that is documented and committed to GitHub.

## How to Run
1. Install Docker on the system
2. Run Node Exporter to collect system metrics
3. Start Prometheus using the provided configuration file
4. Start Grafana and import the dashboard JSON file

## Outcome
- Real-time monitoring of system resources
- Clear and interactive visual dashboards
- Improved understanding of system health
